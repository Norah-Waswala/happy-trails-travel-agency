      adventurous hikes to waterfalls, a nightlife, lively coral reefs, and resorts,

   <h1>The Bahamas</h1>
   <p>The Bahamas is an independent country. It was formerly a British Territory for 325 years. 
       It became independent in 1973 and joined the United Nations during the same year. Despite 
       its proximity to the United States, at no point was the Bahamas ever a U.S. territory.</p>
